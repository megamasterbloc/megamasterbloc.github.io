# here's my website repo
This is the github repo for my personal website. It should be available at [megamasterbloc.github.io@](megamasterbloc.github.io) .

**to-do list :**
- create actual blog posts
- change (once again) all of the CSS and page styling
- buy a domain name (maybe using cloudflare ?)

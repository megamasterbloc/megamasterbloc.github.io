            this is a render of the obsidian logo of <a href="https://discord.com/invite/highways" target="_blank" class="div_main_link">HWU</a> (Highway Workers Union) on the server 2b2t. The render is over 100K chunks large and the resolution is 1:1, meaning that each pixel of the render represent a single bloc from the world. It is an isometric render with the max Y height at 121, you can actually see that near the highways since the rails are at y=121 while the floor is at y=120, thus not rendering the rails.

            <h3>test render</h3>

                    This is a demonstration render that use most of the functionality of <a href="https://chunky-dev.github.io/docs/" target="_blank" class="div_main_link" >Chunky</a>, the rendering software that I use. It is based on a test map and I have added a custom player model, including a custom skin. All of the features worked properly, for example the in-camera blur or the equirectangular projection mode.

                    I&nbsp;am&nbsp;megamasterbloc, or at least that my username since I choose it for my minecraft account when I was 10, but you may see me with other names. This is beacause I am a plural system called the Orion system (yes, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_Nebula" target="_blank" class="nolink c_blue link_wh fs_bold">nebulæ</a>) wich means that my brain is made up of multiples individuals that can take control of my body, if you want more informations about plurality in general you can check the website <a href="https://morethanone.info/" target="_blank" class="nolink c_blue link_wh fs_bold">morethanone.info</a> and if you want to know all about ours alters you can type the command <code>pk;system njlbb</code> in any discord server with the <a href="https://pluralkit.me/" target="_blank" class="nolink c_blue link_wh fs_bold">pluralkit bot</a> installed. I am also a transfem and I use they/them and she/her pronouns, I have several disabilities such as autism, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehlers%E2%80%93Danlos_syndromes" target="_blank" class="nolink c_blue link_wh fs_bold">hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysautonomia" target="_blank" class="nolink c_blue link_wh fs_bold">dysautonomia</a> as well as chronic pain and chronic fatigue. I am a disability rights activist, an internet freedom and privacy activist as well as an anarchist. If you want to contact me securely you can message me at <a href="mailto:megamasterbloc@protonmail.com"class="nolink c_blue link_wh fs_bold">megamasterbloc@protonmail.com</a> and use my <a href="/keys/publickey.megamasterbloc@protonmail.com-3956f7fcf32c2ec922fdb3460fcf1f7944cbd39b.asc" class="nolink c_blue link_wh fs_bold">PGP key</a>.

                    I am a minecraft player since a long time, I am primarily playing on anarchy servers such as 2b2t (I am a member of the group <a href="https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Motorway_Extension_Gurus" target="_blank" class="nolink c_blue link_wh fs_bold">MEG</a> and I have dug more than 50M netherrack) and civilisations servers like <a href="https://stoneworks-mc.tebex.io/" target="_blank" class="nolink c_blue link_wh fs_bold">Stoneworks</a>. When I am not playing minecraft I am regularly making 3d renders of minecraft worlds using <a href="https://chunky-dev.github.io/docs/" target="_blank" class="nolink c_blue link_wh fs_bold">Chunky</a>, a powerfull path tracing renderer, you can view some of my renders <a href="/renders.html" class="nolink c_blue link_wh fs_bold">here</a>. I have also tried <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/user/megamasterbloc" class="nolink c_blue link_wh fs_bold">speedrunning</a> but I'm not very good at it.

                    I am not really a developer as I don't participate in any projects but I have learned some HTML and CSS thanks to this website as well as some python. I enjoy doing a lot of things with computers, currently I'm learning server and network stuff but I'm always willing to learn something new. I also have a lot of knowledge about smartphones, cameras and photography in general, in fact the picture of the moon on my <a href="https://github.com/megamasterbloc" target="_blank" class="nolink c_blue link_wh fs_bold">github profile</a> is an homemade one as I took it during a partial lunar eclipse which was stacked using <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230604160523/https://sites.google.com/site/astropipp/" target="_blank" class="nolink c_blue link_wh fs_bold">PPIP</a> and <a href="https://www.autostakkert.com/" target="_blank" class="nolink c_blue link_wh fs_bold">AutoStakkert!</a>.

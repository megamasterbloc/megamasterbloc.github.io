Hi, I'm megamasterbloc and I was banned earlier for "spamming 2x2 spruces trees", here is my  appeal.
I want to start by saying that I understand mco rules and why they are so important to the preservation of the server, I want to follow the rules and play according to them. I also want to point out that I am a trans women and I use she/her and they/them pronouns.
a little bit of story so you can understand what happened:
After I built the hearth lake hut I began planting some spruce trees around it witch quickly evolved into 2x2 spruce trees, I really like how it look and I thought of making a big forest out of it. at first it was very tedious as I didn't have a lot of saplings but I found out I could go to the iron reef to get a lot of them, at that moment I knew I had to do a really big forest as it was only a matter of planting a lot of trees and so I began extending the forest rapidly. I then spend dozens of hours planting trees, sometime being floating trees (bc otherwise they would't grow due to adjacent blocs). Yesterday I msg luigi about this forest, luigi is my favorite mod and is very friendly with me, he said he really liked it and was waiting for when it would be complete (note: at that moment I didn't had a plan to stop the expansion of the forest), a few hours later I was banned and the rest is history (I have to say that the wiki article explain really well what happened after that moment, I should try to contribute as I have some screenshots of the forest).
what I have to say:
I want to say that when planting the forest at no moment I did it with the intend of griefing, in this case addition griefing, other players builds. My goal was to plan trees on natural terrain, witch is what I did at the beginning, but after I while I started planing them in areas with a lot of buildings, sometime even inside other players builds. when planting the forest I didn't realized I was doing something bad but now I completely understand why it was against the rules.
I read the rules (the ones on the wiki) multiples times, even before planting the forest, and I should have realized that it was addition griefing. however when planting the forest my idea was that since trees are naturals structures they would not count toward addition grief as they are not builds but naturally generated structures (the saplings are not but the growned tree is, I placed saplings and some dirt but it is the server that spawned logs and foliage) and any player could log the forest and it would no count as griefing as it is not my build. I was wrong, very wrong.
I understand the decision to ban me, griefing is a very serious offense and mco staff is responsible to enforce those rules, they have not failed to do so. I want to apologies for any players who's builds was affected by the trees I planted and for any players that had to spend time removing those tree and I can only respect the hard work that those players did as the task was as big as the forest was. Logcheck being logcheck I was banned while not being online on the server, this mean that I could not knew what charges were against me until I logged in again and I didn't had the chance to speak for myself and defend my case before being banned, this is not an excuse to what I did but it is worth taking into account. If I was told beforehand that it was addition grief and that I could get banned for what I did I would have offered to remove those trees, I have spent a lot of time planting this forest but if it was necessary I would have spend even more time removing it. 
I understand that appealing a ban is not an instant unban but rather a careful review of the situation and I am very thankful for the admin that will review my case as there is a lot to it. At the end of the day it is your decision and only your decision that matter, I realize that I don't have a lot of chances being unbanned but at least I was heard and I will accept the decision you will take, whatever it will be. Dura lex, sed lex.
If you have any question or want any information that I may be able to anwser feel free to ask me on discord.
